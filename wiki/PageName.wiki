= Introduction =

The xsd2cpp tool is a C++ code generator. The xsd2cpp tool when invoked on an input XML Schema, generates C++ classes(headers) mapped to the input XML Schema components. Alongside, wherever needed, it generates implementation files(.cpp) for the generated C++ classes. Also, a sample application(main.cpp) is generated to show how an application could consume the generated C++ source files.
