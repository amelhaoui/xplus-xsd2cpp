# XmlPlus Documentation

= Introduction =

XmlPlus is a C++ XML Data Binding Tool.
XmlPlus provides following utilities:
 * X/O mapping:
   XmlPlus xsd2cpp automatically generates C++ classes mapped to XML-Schema components. The in-memory objects holding xml data are also known as XML-Objects. The applications interact with xml data directly through in-memory objects, rather than using DOM/SAX APIs.
 * Parsing ie. Deserialization/Unmarshalling
 * Parser to read valid XML documents into in-memory XML-Objects
 * Marshalling/Serialization
   Writer to write the XML-Objects to xml files

An application using xsd2cpp generated C++ classes(XML-Objects), has to interact only with readymade in-memory object-interface. These objects hide(and save) all the complexities of XML I/O from(for) the application. Thus, one is saved from writing XML I/O implementations(ie. Classes to hold xml data, alongwith Serialization/Deserialization code) for xml data.


= About xsd2cpp =

The xsd2cpp tool is a C++ code generator. The xsd2cpp tool when invoked on an input XML Schema, generates C++ classes(headers) mapped to the input XML Schema components. Alongside, wherever needed, it generates implementation files(.cpp) for the generated C++ classes. Also, a sample application(main.cpp) is generated to show how an application could consume the generated C++ source files.
